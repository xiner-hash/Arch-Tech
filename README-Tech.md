## Description

Welcome to the Technology Evolution Visualization Tool, an interactive Shiny app designed to facilitate the exploration of technology usage trends over the years. This user guide will walk you through the key functionalities of the program.

### Correlation Plot (Correlation.R)

In 'Correlation.R', you can explore the correlation between different technologies within the selected category for a specific year. Here is how to use this feature:

* Category Selection: Choose a category of interest from the drop-down menu.

* Year Selection: Use the slider to specify the year for which you want to view correlations within the selected category.

The program will then generate a correlation plot illustrating the relationships between all the technologies in the chosen category for the selected year.

### Stacked Bar Chart (3D Bar.R)

'3D Bar.R' allows you to visualize the usage of all technologies within a selected category over the years 2012 to 2023 using a stacked bar chart:

* Category Selection: Start by selecting a category from the drop-down menu.

After choosing a category, the application will create a stacked bar chart showing the usage trends of all technologies within that category from 2012 to 2023.

### Comprehensive Overview (3D Bar (All Category).R)

Please explore '3D Bar (All Category).R' for a comprehensive view of technology usage across all 11 categories over the same time frame. In this program, you will find a stacked bar chart depicting technology usage trends across all 11 categories from 2012 to 2023. No category selection is required in this view.
